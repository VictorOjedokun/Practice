# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Automated pipeline to **build, test, and deploy applications** using GitHub Actions.

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** implemented using **GitHub Actions**.  
The pipeline is designed to:
- Automatically **build and test** the application on every push or pull request.
- Deploy the application to the desired environment after successful tests.

It ensures **fast feedback, reduced errors, and efficient delivery**.

## ✅ Features
- Automated Build: Compiles and validates the application on every code change.
- Automated Testing: Runs unit/integration tests before deployment.
- Deployment: Deploys to production or staging environments automatically.
- Branch Protection: CI runs on `development` and `main` branches.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. Developer pushes code → GitHub triggers workflow.
2. Pipeline executes:
    - Checkout code
    - Install dependencies
    - Run tests
    - Build artifact
    - Deploy (if tests pass)
3. Deployment happens on **merge to main** branch.


## 🔧 Technologies Used
- GitHub Actions – CI/CD orchestration
- YAML – Workflow configuration
- Language/Framework – Application code (Node.js)
- Hosting Platform – AWS
